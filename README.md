Complex Adaptive Dynamics Computer Aided Design (cadCAD) is a language for encoding Generalized Dynamical Systems (GDS) as computer programs. This repository contains the reference implementation of the software, based on the formal specification. Python was chosen for the reference implementation for clarity and ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Easy Mode
Clone this repository, create a notebook at the root of it, and import cadcad in the notebook. Recommended if you only want to use this version and do not intend to contribute to the repo.

### Dev Environment Set Up
Alternatively, if you wish to set up a development environment to work from, please follow the instructions in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.


## Contributing

## Ontology

cadCAD and GDS share an ontology based on Block Diagrams. Block Diagrams are generalizations of circuit diagrams that represent the flow of infomation. In cadCAD the central concepts are Points, Spaces, Blocks and Systems. Blocks are wired together through composition rules which include requirements for matching Spaces -- which can be thought of as ensuring that the wires types match. When you wire blocks together, they form a system if the output can be used as inputs forming an iterative process. Points capture the instantaneous information, and systems produce sequences of points called Trajectories. Where systems are abstract representations of evolutionary dynamics, Trajectors are concrete sequeces of points generated by those systems. By creating a formal Block Diagram based language for expressing systems, we can more easily compare systems. This includes comparisons of different trajectories generated by the same system, as well as properties of related systems.
